		@Html.LabelFor(m => m.Movie.GenreId) @*At first when I loaded the Edit view, the movie's genre wasn't populating in the dropdwon. Then it was erroring out when I went to save. That's because this was previously m.Genres. THAT WAS INCORRECT. I needed to add "pulbic byte GenreId" prop to Movie.cs which acts as a foreign key to Genres table. Before, when I was jsut referencing m => m.Genres, that was a property of the VIEWMODEL (a list, specifically) and not the movie entity that was passed INTO the viewModel in via the Edit method*@
